# Elastic Workflows & AI Workshop — For SREs & Platform Engineers

## Build Self-Healing Systems: Eliminate Toil with Automated Remediation

### The Problem
**3AM alert fires** → Switch between 4 tools → Query logs → Run remediation → Document → **15-30 minutes, manual toil**

### The Solution
**Alert fires** → Workflow queries ES → AI analyzes → API remediates → **30 seconds, zero toil**

---

## What You'll Build (4 hours, hands-on)

• **AI + Workflows Integration**: Give AI agents workflows as tools (the "full circle")  
• **Self-Healing AI**: Alert fires → AI analyzes service health → API restarts failing service automatically  
• **Business Impact Detection**: Payment drop detected → Auto-scale infrastructure + AI explains impact to stakeholders

---

## Skills You'll Master

• **ES|QL for SREs** — Fast root cause analysis with multi-metric queries  
• **AI-Powered Observability** — Multi-agent patterns, deterministic logic + AI explanations  
• **Alert-Triggered Automation** — Error handling, retry logic, external API integration  
• **Workflow Orchestration** — Chain HTTP calls, ES queries, AI agents seamlessly

---

## Why This Matters

✅ **Reduce MTTR by 90%** — Automate the first 5 minutes of every incident  
✅ **Eliminate Toil** — No more manual restarts, scaling, or remediation  
✅ **Scale Your Team** — Workflows handle incidents 24/7 without paging  
✅ **Modern SRE Skills** — AI + Automation is the future of reliability engineering
